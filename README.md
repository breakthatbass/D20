# D20

D20 is a program that rolls dice for dungeons and dragons

### Usage:

The program takes two arguments, the first is the type of die to roll (e.g. 20 for a D20) and the second is how many rolls.

```
$ python dice.py 20 3
```
would return something like:

```
Roll 1 is 7
Roll 2 is 20. Critical hit!
Roll 3 is 16
```
